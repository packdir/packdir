Speaker recognition is the identification of a person from characteristics of voices.[1] It is used to answer the question "Who is speaking?" The term voice recognition[2][3][4][5][6] can refer to speaker recognition or speech recognition. Speaker verification (also called speaker authentication) contrasts with identification, and speaker recognition differs from speaker diarisation (recognizing when the same speaker is speaking).
