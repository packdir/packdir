Svelte 与传统框架截然不同，因为它将组件编译为高度优化的普通 JavaScript，从而实现最小的开销和更快的加载时间。 为了进一步增强开发体验，SvelteKit 提供了一个与 Svelte 无缝集成的强大框架，提供了额外的功能，并使构建全功能、全堆栈应用程序变得更加容易。

在设计 Web 应用程序样式时，TailwindCSS 是一个高度可定制、实用性优先的 CSS 框架，可促进快速开发和可维护代码。 通过合并 DaisyUI（一个构建在 TailwindCSS 之上的组件库），您可以以最少的努力快速创建有吸引力且一致的用户界面。

最后，我们将探索 Cloudflare Pages，这是一个用于部署和托管静态网站和 Jamstack 应用程序的尖端平台。 Cloudflare Pages 提供超快的性能、从 GitHub 存储库自动部署以及许多其他功能，使其成为开发人员的首选。

## SvelteKit

主要特点：

1. File-based routing: SvelteKit uses a file-based routing system, which means that your application's routes are automatically determined based on the structure of your project's source files. This makes it easy to create and manage routes without any complex configuration.

2. Built-in server rendering: SvelteKit includes built-in server-side rendering (SSR) support, allowing you to create dynamic, SEO-friendly web applications that load quickly and perform well.

3. Static site generation: With SvelteKit, you can also generate static sites, which can be deployed to any static hosting provider. This is perfect for creating fast, lightweight websites or blogs that don't require server-side rendering.

4. Hybrid rendering: SvelteKit supports hybrid rendering, allowing you to mix server-rendered and statically-generated routes within the same application. This provides the flexibility to choose the best approach for each part of your application, based on your specific needs.

5. Adapter system: SvelteKit's adapter system makes it easy to deploy your application to a variety of hosting platforms, including popular options like Netlify, Vercel, and Cloudflare Pages. This allows you to choose the best deployment option for your project without worrying about compatibility issues.

6. Integrated development environment: SvelteKit includes a built-in development server and other helpful development tools, making it easy to test and preview your application as you build it.
